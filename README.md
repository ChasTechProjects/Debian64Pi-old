# Debian64Pi
64-bit Debian Stretch for the Raspberry Pi 3

This is a 64-bit Debian Stretch image that works on the Raspberry Pi 3. It is a minimal image built upon the Debian ARM64 base but with a kernel and firmware that works on the Raspberry Pi 3.

## Status
*Keyboard, mouse, and Ethernet are working.
*XFCE desktop loaded successfully and can load applications such as Chromium and LibreOffice.
*Multiarch in apt works -- can add armhf as an alternative architecture and load armhf programs.
*Snaps can be installed after installing snapd.
*Pi 3's built in WiFi currently not working, despite kernel modules including drivers for it were installed.

Image coming very soon.
